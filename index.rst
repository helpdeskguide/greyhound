If you've booked a Greyhound trip and can't find your ticket, don't worry—it’s easy to retrieve. Start by checking your email (including spam) for a confirmation with your e-ticket. You can also log in to your account on the official site, www.greyhound.com, or use the Greyhound mobile app to access your booking. If you have your confirmation number, use the "Manage Trip" feature to recover your ticket. Still stuck? Visit a nearby Greyhound terminal with ID and travel details for help. Digital tickets are accepted, so printing isn't always necessary.
How to Find Your Greyhound Bus Ticket
=====================================

1. Check Your Email Confirmation
--------------------------------

When you book a ticket online or through the app, Greyhound sends a confirmation email with your e-ticket. Search your inbox or spam folder for keywords like:

- "Greyhound confirmation"  
- "Greyhound e-ticket"  
- "GreyhoundBusTicket"  

The ticket is usually attached as a PDF or shown as a QR code in the email.

2. Use the Greyhound App
------------------------

If you used the GreyhoundBus app to book, open the app:

- Go to **My Trips** or **Bookings**  
- Log in with the email used during booking  
- Your ticket, travel time, and seat number should appear  
- Show the digital ticket at boarding  

3. Log Into Your Greyhound Account
----------------------------------

Visit **https://greyhound.com** and follow these steps:

- Click on **My Account**  
- Enter your email and password  
- Go to **Trip History** or **Bookings**  
- Download or print your GreyhoundBusTicket  

4. Use the Confirmation Number
------------------------------

If you remember your confirmation number but lost the email:

- Go to **greyhound.com**  
- Select **Manage Trip**  
- Enter your confirmation number and last name  
- Access and re-download your ticket  

5. Visit a Greyhound Terminal
-----------------------------

Still can’t find your ticket? Visit the nearest Greyhound terminal and speak to a staff member. Bring:

My Experience Using Greyhound

Losing a printed ticket used to be stressful, but with today’s digital systems, retrieving it is easy anytime.
